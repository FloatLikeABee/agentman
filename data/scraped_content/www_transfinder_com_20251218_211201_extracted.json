  "detailed_content": "At the 2025 Transporting Students with Disabilities and Special Needs (TSD) Conference held at the Frisco Convention Center, Transfinder presented a standout Technology Demo Ride Along aboard a Type C school bus provided by Garland ISD. Unlike static exhibits, this live demonstration allowed attendees to experience Transfinder’s transportation solutions in real-world conditions during a 20-minute loop around Frisco, Texas.\n\nThe demo showcased two core platforms: Routefinder PLUS and Wayfinder. Key features demonstrated included live routing adjustments that responded dynamically to simulated traffic scenarios, AI-powered alerts for stop-arm violations that sent instant notifications, and tablet-based workflows that simplified driver pre-trip inspections. High-precision GPS tracking—accurate down to the curb—was emphasized to ensure realistic and reliable performance.\n\nJohn Daniels, Transfinder’s Vice President of Marketing, explained that the goal was to let participants see how drivers and dispatchers use these tools daily. The experience was designed to reflect actual operational use, offering conference attendees an immersive look into modern school transportation technology.",
