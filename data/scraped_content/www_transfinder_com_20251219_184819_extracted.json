  "detailed_content": "At the Transporting Students with Disabilities and Special Needs (TSD) Conference in Frisco, Texas, a panel of three female special needs routing specialists—Sierra Long (Garland ISD, TX), Bailey Wouters (Melissa ISD, TX), and Yvonne Morrison (Widefield School District #3, CO)—shared how technology enhances special education transportation.\n\nGarland ISD transports 1,000 students on 77 daily SPED routes. They replaced paper route sheets with Transfinder’s digital system, equipping buses with tablets that provide drivers and monitors with student-specific information. This change improved safety by eliminating distractions from paper documents and enabled real-time route updates due to road conditions. Parent inquiries dropped significantly thanks to the Stopfinder app, which provides real-time bus location data. The district used a pilot rollout and extensive training to support staff adoption. Routefinder software allows them to route dozens of students per hour, and risk management teams can instantly identify affected students in case of an accident. Special education teachers also access student locations via Viewfinder.\n\nMelissa ISD, serving about 170 special needs students, switched to Transfinder from another routing platform due to its usability. Parent calls decreased as information became more accessible through the Stopfinder app, which includes geographic filters to notify families when buses approach designated stops or face delays (e.g., from construction). Wouters highlighted Transfinder’s map view for SPED students and easy route adjustments. She noted that having all data in one place allows staff to focus more on student care.\n\nWidefield School District #3 in Colorado Springs transports just over 200 students with disabilities on 27 routes. Currently using paper attendance sheets alongside separate routing and GPS systems, they are implementing Routefinder PLUS and rolling out the Wayfinder driver app to unify operations. Morrison stressed the need to consolidate information onto a single platform to reduce confusion during parent inquiries about student whereabouts. The district aims to digitize check-in/check-out processes and improve real-time responsiveness.\n\nAll panelists agreed on the critical role of digital records during emergencies. RFID cards help track student locations, and route changes automatically trigger prepopulated parent notifications via Stopfinder. Additionally, driver feedback mechanisms in Routefinder allow for accurate alignment between planned and actual routes, including specifications like right-side pickups.",
